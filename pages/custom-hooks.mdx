# Custom hooks 

Hooks are built in functions in react that can hook into react internals. They are APIs that expose some react functionality like
- create & access state from fiber tree
- register side effects in fiber tree
- manually select DOM 
- always start with "use" 
- Can create custom hooks for reuse non visual logic.
- 20 built in hooks 


| Most used      | Less used | Library authors     |
| :---        |    :---   |          :--- |
| useState,useEffect, useReducer, useContext | useRef, useCallback, useMemo,useTransition, useDeferredValue      | useSyncExternalStore, useInsertionEffect       |

### Rarely used 

- useLayoutEffect 
- useDebugValue
- useImperativeHandle
- useId

### Rules 

- should only call at the top level 
- not within conditional statements 
- they should always be called at the exact order 
- can only be called from function components / custom hooks 
- auto enforced with ESLint 
- when react builds a fiber tree, which also contains a linked list of hooks used, and unless the hooks are called in same order, the linked list will break. Fibers are not destroyed / recreated on every render. 

### For react to consider a value on initial render only, use the function syntax 

```js
// Correct one ✅ - lazy evaluation. Function must be pure without arguments.
const [val, setVal] = useState(() => {
  const localStorageVal = localStorage.getItem("watched");
  return JSON.parse(localStorageVal);
})

// Do not do this ❌
useState(localStorage.getItem('something'))
```

### Refs 

For selecting DOM element, use refs. Direct access with jQuery or javascript apis isnt the react way.
Ref is like a box and we can put any value that needs to be persisted across renders. Assigning values to ref will not trigger re-render.
Ref are for data that is not rendered. They may appear in event handlers & effects, not in JSX 

```js
import { useRef } from 'react'

const elRef = useRef(null);
elRef.current = 1000; // direct assignments are possible.
elRef.current.focus() // call methods 

<input ref={elRef}/>
```
Custom hooks allow us to reuse non visual logic in multiple components.

```js 
// useMovies.js 

export function useMovies() {
  return {
    movies,
    onSelect
  }
}

// within component 
const {movies, onSelect} = useMovies()
```
