# State events & Forms

- State is data that a component can hold over time.
- State is internal data owned by the component.
- Memory of the component
- State is a single local component variable
- Updating state re-renders the component & its view.
- Local state variables are persisted between re-renders.
- With props, whenever the component recieves new prop from its parent, it re-renders.

```js 
const Header = ({ name }) => {
  const handleClick = () => {}
  const handleHover = (xCoord, yCoord) => {}
  <>
   <h1>{name}</h1>
   <button onClick={handleClick}> click </button>
    <button onClick={e => handleHover(e.pageX, e.pageY)}> hover </button>
   </>
}
export default Header
```

### State 

- do not directly assign state with new values.
- only use `useState` hook for updating state 
- state can be primitives or reference types.
- If it is object, make sure to copy other slices too when updating one property of the object.
- When state is updated, component is re-rendered.
- Install react dev tools to have a visual medium for debugging. (props, state etc can be seen)
- Each component instance manages its own state slice.

```js

import { useState } from 'react'

const Header = () => {
 const [name, setName] = useState('');

 return (
  <>
   <p> {name} </p>
   <button onChange={() => setName('Jim')}> Change </button>
 )
}
```

### State update syntax 

Updating state is asynchronous. Don't think that just because we called setState, the state updated and component instantly rerendered. Basically, react schedules state updates.

```js 
// if we just need to set a value
setState(10);

// if next state value depends on the previous
setState(currVal => currVal + 1)

```

### Forms 

- Controlled & uncontrolled forms.
- Controlled elements are those whose values are tied with component state.
- Uncontrolled elements are those whose values aren't tied with state.
- event in react is Synthetic Events. They are cross browser wrapper around native browser events. So, consistency and compatibility across browsers is guarenteed.

```js 
// Example of a controlled form
const Form = () => {

  const [userName, setUserName] = useState();
  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setUserName(e.target.value)
  }
  const handleSubmit = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> 
     <input value={userName} onChange={handleChange}/>
     <button> Submit </button>
    </form>
  )
}
```
## Thinking in state & its management 

- we need to think in react way. The mental model needs to be right. 
- Break the UI into smaller reusable composable components.
- State management is key for building performant apps. Think about global & local state.
- We should know when & where to create the state & at what level.
- Establish a data flow. ( One way data flow, child to parent communication, access global state)
- If possible, have derived state from available state slices
- Lift state up when state needs to be shared across siblings.
- Decide when to create pieces of state, what type of state is necessary, where to place the state, how data flows through the app.
- Local state is needed for only that particular component. That can be passed down to its children as props.
- Global state can be handled with Context API / redux.

### State - Rule of thumb

- If the state never changes, we can assign it to a const.
- If it changes, then ask, whether we can derive the value from an existing state.
- Should state change re-render a component? If yes, `useState` is a good option, else `useRef`
- Lift state up by one level if we need to share state with siblings.
- Whenever possible, try to derive state from existing states & not add more slices of state unnecessary.
- Do early return from the components whenever possible.
- An input, whenever we put a `value`, we also need to put `onChange`. Else console errors.
- Prop drilling will be a problem beyond a point.
